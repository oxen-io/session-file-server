    API documentation for the Session file server.  This is the API that
    [Session](https://getsession.org) and related tools use to interface with encrypted, stored
    files that are sent to and retrieved from the file server via onion requests.

      summary: "Uploads a file to the file server."
      description: >
        Uploads an opaque file (typically encrypted) to the file server.  This takes the file body
        as binary.


        This endpoint de-duplicates: that is, uploading an identical file body (which also implies
        identical encryption) will *not* store the file a second time: instead it just updates the
        file expiry.

                      endpoint for retrieval.  Will contain only path-safe characters from
                      `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`.
                      

                      Currently this identifier is a 44 character value (264 bits, in base64
                      encoding, chosen to be the smallest padding-free base64 encodable size >= 256
                      bits), but that may change in future versions and should not be relied upon.

      description: >
        Uploads an opaque file (typically encrypted) to the file server.  This takes the file body
        as a json parameter, encoded in base64.  It is mainly provided for backwards compatibility:
        see the `/file` endpoint which uses 25% less data by avoiding an unnecessary extra layer of
        base64 encoding.


        This endpoint also always returns the file id as an integer in the range [0, 2^53], and does
        not de-duplicate identical uploads.


        This is deprecated and will be removed in the future once all known users have migrated to
        the `/file` endpoint.
